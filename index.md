I am a faculty member in the Marine Engineering Department of Marine Campus at British Columbia Institute of Technology. I have also taught power engineering in the Power Engineering Department at BCIT. Prior to joining BCIT, I have worked on various types of ocean-going ships. My seagoing experience includes a wide range of commercial ships, such as bulk carriers, product oil tankers, and crude oil carriers. When off-duty, I enjoy reading, listening to music, hiking, and traveling.
