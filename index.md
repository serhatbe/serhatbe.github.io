I’m a faculty member in the Marine Engineering Department at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Marine Campus. I’ve also taught in the Power Engineering Department at BCIT. Before joining the institute, I worked on various ocean-going ships, including bulk carriers, product tankers, and crude oil carriers. In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to music, hiking, and traveling.
