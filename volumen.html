<h1>Volūmen</h1>
<p>Volūmen is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes.
However, I primarily use A5 notebooks and write by hand to process my
thoughts. The term volūmen is Latin for “roll” or “scroll,” referring to
a rolled manuscript. In Roman times, a volūmen (plural: volūmina) was
the standard form of written text before the codex i.e. bound book
became widespread.</p>

<p>Borges wrote and lectured extensively on the art of translation,
holding that a translation may improve upon the original, may even be
unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory
renderings of the same work can be equally valid.</p>

<p>We build tools to create objects, ideas, and dreams. These tools and
their creations slip quietly into our souls, remaking us into strangers
to our former selves. As they can do good or harm, we must carefully
design them. This can be a vicious cycle; thus, we must strive for a
virtuous one.</p>

<p>Last update:2024-01-05</p>
<p>To the beginner: practice without effort is not true practice; the
practice needs great effort.</p>
<p>Practice little by little. When walking in a fog, you don’t realize
you’re getting wet, but as you keep walking, you get wet little by
little. When you get in a fog, it’s very difficult to dry yourself.
Practicing slowly is the same; true progress is the result of slow
practice, little by little.</p>
<p>When you keep this simple practice, you will obtain some wonderful
powers. Before you attain it, it’s something wonderful, but after you
attain it, it’s nothing special.</p>
<p>Stop and think: what is wonderful is the act of practice itself. Now
you can restart and keep practicing.</p>
<p>When there’s no gaining idea in what you do, then you do
something.</p>
<p>Forget all gaining ideas, all dualistic ideas. Just practice zazen in
a certain posture.</p>

<h1 id="bullshit-jobs">Bullshit Jobs</h1>
<p>Last update:2023-09-11</p>
<h2 id="brief-summary">Brief Summary</h2>
<p>A bullshit job is one that even the person doing it secretly believes
need not, or should not, exist. That if the job, or even the whole
industry, were to vanish, either it would make no difference to anyone,
or the world might even be a slightly better place.</p>
<p>David Graeber <span class="citation"
data-cites="graeberBullshitJobsTheory2018">Graeber (2018)</span>lists
five different categories of job types: flunkies (whose job is to make
the boss feel good), goons (such as corporate lobbyists whose job is to
fight goons from other companies), duct tapers (who fix errors), box
tickers (people who use paperwork or gestures to make it seem like they
are busy) and taskmasters (people who manage but are unneeded). These
jobs exist because people do not want to be accused of being lazy;
modern managers want to justify their jobs and to create a sense of
corporate feudalism. There are five types of bullshit jobs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important,
e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store
greeters, makers of websites whose sites neglect ease of use and speed
for looks;</li>
<li>Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their
employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public
relations specialists, community managers;</li>
<li>Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed
permanently, e.g., programmers repairing bloated code, airline desk
staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive;</li>
<li>Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is
being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house
magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers, quality
service managers;</li>
<li>Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it,
e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lessons-from-the-book">Lessons from the Book</h2>
<p>Many jobs are pointless or most jobs have elements of pointless
activities. Pay attention to the people and the positions they hold. If
you identify any of the five types, do not waste your precious time.
Most importantly if you discover your job is nothing but bs, you must
find ways to deal with its latent consequences. Many people suffered
from bs jobs and others occupied themselves with learning other skills
(e.g. languages, programming, etc.) while holding bs jobs.</p>

<p>Some memory lapses occur because we become self-conscious. Let go of
self-consciousness and allow the energy of the music, and of the fear
and excitement of performing, to flow freely through our body and mind.

<h2 id="a-ten-step-approach">A Ten-Step Approach</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Stretch</li>
<li>Settle down in your environment: Be present, correct posture,
breathing.</li>
<li>Tune into your heart: Recalling profound feelings is how to tune
into your heart.</li>
<li>Use your body in a comfortable and natural way. Mechanics, habits
and emotions…</li>
<li>Follow your curiosity as you practice.</li>
<li>Recognize three styles of struggle:
<ol type="1">
<li>Overstated passion, in which we cling to the music.</li>
<li>Avoidance, in which we resist dealing with the music.</li>
<li>Aggression, in which we attack the music.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Drop your attitudes and be simple.</li>
<li>Apply three listening techniques:
<ol type="1">
<li>Sing the notes and lines.</li>
<li>Place your attention on the vibrations.</li>
<li>Place your attention on each sound as it resonates in the space
around you.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Organize notes into groups, phrases, and textures.</li>
<li>Place your attention on the sensations of touch and movement.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Relax, tension is your worst enemy</li>
<li>Hear the music you’re playing</li>
<li>Be gentle to yourself</li>
<li>Do not over practice, short mindful work is superior to long
laboured practice sessions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-notes">Miscellaneous Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Swing the music instead of sounding like sewing machine. Group notes
and play them by creating a forward motion.</li>
<li>Focus on more on the sensations of touch and movement and use your
vision mainly to check that what you feel is in accord with what you
see. <span class="citation"
data-cites="bruserArtPracticingGuide1999">Bruser &amp; Menuhin (1999, p.

<li>Think the sound you make. Then discover the sensation your brain has
created for you. <span class="citation"
