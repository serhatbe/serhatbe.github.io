<h1>Volūmen</h1>
<p>Volūmen is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes.
However, I mainly use notebooks and write by hand to process my
thoughts. The term volūmen is Latin for “scroll,” referring to a rolled
manuscript. In ancient Rome, a volūmen (plural: volūmina) was the
standard format for written texts before the codex, or bound book,
became common.</p>

<p>Daniel Kahneman said most people make quick judgments and then try to
prove themselves right. The wisest wait, gather facts, and trust their
intuition last.</p>
<p>I recently learned that Kahneman passed away on March 27, 2024,
though his death wasn’t announced until March 2025. He was best known
for his work on System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is fast and
automatic but prone to errors. System 2 is slower and more deliberate,
used for careful thinking and problem-solving.</p>

<h1 id="tools">Tools</h1>
<p>Last update: 2025-07-27</p>
<p>We build tools to create objects, ideas, and dreams. These tools and
their creations slip quietly into our souls, remaking us into strangers
to our former selves. As they can do good or harm, we must carefully
design them. This can be a vicious cycle; thus, we must strive for a
virtuous one.</p>

<p>Last update: 2025-07-24</p>
<p>Borges wrote and lectured extensively on the art of translation,
holding that a translation may improve upon the original, may even be
unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory
renderings of the same work can be equally valid.</p>

<p>Last update: 2025-05-31</p>
<p>Concision is to mind what cleanliness is to the body. Concision, like
cleanliness, plays a crucial role in personal and professional life.
Just as cleanliness eliminates dirt and clutter from the body, concision
eliminates unnecessary words and ideas from communication, leaving
behind clear, precise, and effective messages.</p>
<p>A concise mind expresses ideas efficiently, avoiding redundancy or
overcomplication—just as a clean body is free from excess grime. In both
cases, the result is clarity, ease, and refinement.</p>

<p>Last update: 2024-05-07</p>
<p>Who should have the burden of proof?</p>
<ul>
<li>To sort things out, the one who’s causing the mess in the first
place should carry the burden of proof.<br />
</li>
<li>In any interaction, the one taking action—rather than the one
responding—should bear the burden of proof.<br />
</li>
<li>In cases of organizations vs. individuals, especially in hazardous
situations, the organization should carry the burden of proof. Still,
individuals must use their own judgment to stay safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, do justly, the best you can—and keep course correcting.
Remember what Dylan said: “All the truth in the world adds up to one big
lie.”</p>

<p>Last update: 2024-01-05</p>
<p>To the beginner: practice without effort is not true practice; the
practice needs great effort.</p>
<p>Practice little by little. When walking in a fog, you don’t realize
you’re getting wet, but as you keep walking, you get wet little by
little. When you get in a fog, it’s very difficult to dry yourself.
Practicing slowly is the same; true progress is the result of slow
practice, little by little.</p>
<p>When you keep this simple practice, you will obtain some wonderful
powers. Before you attain it, it’s something wonderful, but after you
attain it, it’s nothing special.</p>
<p>Stop and think: what is wonderful is the act of practice itself. Now
you can restart and keep practicing.</p>
<p>When there’s no gaining idea in what you do, then you do
something.</p>
<p>Forget all gaining ideas, all dualistic ideas. Just practice zazen in
a certain posture.</p>

<h1 id="bullshit-jobs">Bullshit Jobs</h1>
<p>Last update: 2023-August-11</p>
<h2 id="brief-summary">Brief Summary</h2>
<p>A bullshit job is one that even the person doing it secretly believes
need not, or should not, exist. That if the job, or even the whole
industry, were to vanish, either it would make no difference to anyone,
or the world might even be a slightly better place.</p>
<p>David Graeber lists five different categories of job types <span
class="citation" data-cites="graeberBullshitJobsTheory2018">Graeber
(2018)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important,
e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store
greeters, makers of websites whose sites neglect ease of use and speed
for looks;</li>
<li>Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their
employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public
relations specialists, community managers;</li>
<li>Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed
permanently, e.g., programmers repairing bloated code, airline desk
staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive;</li>
<li>Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is
being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house
magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers, quality
service managers;</li>
<li>Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it,
e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lessons-from-the-book">Lessons from the Book</h2>
<p>Many jobs are pointless or most jobs have elements of pointless
activities. Pay attention to the people and the positions they hold. If
you identify any of the five types, do not waste your precious time.
Most importantly if you discover your job is nothing but bs, you must
find ways to deal with its latent consequences. Many people suffered
from bs jobs and others occupied themselves with learning other skills
(e.g. languages, programming, etc.) while holding bs jobs.</p>

<h1 id="on-problem-solving">On Problem-solving</h1>
<p>Last update: 2025-05-31</p>
<p>Some problems come from life itself—they shape us, test us, make us
stronger. Struggling with them gives the soul weight and meaning. But
other problems are man-made—born of fear, control, and small minds. They
do not lift us up; they drain us. In places ruled by politics and
pretense, effort leads nowhere. Spirit fades. It is better to face real
storms than to rot in still air. Better a hard truth than a quiet,
comfortable lie.</p>

<h1 id="on-stupidity">On Stupidity</h1>
<p>Last update: 2025-05-04</p>
<p>The basic laws assert that (<span class="citation"
data-cites="cipollaBasicLawsHuman2019">Cipolla (2019)</span>)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Always and inevitably everyone underestimates the number of stupid
individuals in circulation.</li>
<li>The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of
any characteristic of that person.</li>
<li>A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or
to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly
incurring losses.</li>
<li>Non-stupid people always underestimate the damaging power of stupid
individuals. In particular non-stupid people constantly forget that at
all times and places and under any circumstances to deal and/or
associate with stupid people infallibly turns out to be a costly
mistake.</li>
<li>A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person. A stupid
person is more dangerous than a bandit.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Intelligence and stupidity are not the opposite of one another, nor
is stupidity the lack of intelligence, but intelligence is the product,
more or less unsuccessful, of a continuous series of attempts to
dominate, or escape, the stupidity that constitutes everything that is
human — Matthijs Van Boxsel.</p>

<p>Some memory lapses occur because we become self-conscious. Let go of
self-consciousness and allow the energy of the music, and of the fear
and excitement of performing, to flow freely through our body and mind.
<span class="citation" data-cites="bruserArtPracticingGuide1999">Bruser
&amp; Menuhin (1999, p. 216)</span>.</p>
<p>We have one lifetime in which to express ourselves and to connect to

chance, and we want to give it everything we have. <span

<ol type="1">
<li>Stretch</li>
<li>Settle down in your environment: Be present, correct posture,
breathing.</li>
<li>Tune into your heart: Recalling profound feelings is how to tune
into your heart.</li>
<li>Use your body in a comfortable and natural way. Mechanics, habits
and emotions…</li>
<li>Follow your curiosity as you practice.</li>
<li>Recognize three styles of struggle:
<ol type="1">
<li>Overstated passion, in which we cling to the music.</li>
<li>Avoidance, in which we resist dealing with the music.</li>
<li>Aggression, in which we attack the music.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Drop your attitudes and be simple.</li>
<li>Apply three listening techniques:
<ol type="1">
<li>Sing the notes and lines.</li>
<li>Place your attention on the vibrations.</li>
<li>Place your attention on each sound as it resonates in the space
around you.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Organize notes into groups, phrases, and textures.</li>
<li>Place your attention on the sensations of touch and movement.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Relax, tension is your worst enemy</li>
<li>Hear the music you’re playing</li>
<li>Be gentle to yourself</li>
<li>Do not over practice, short mindful work is superior to long
laboured practice sessions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-notes">Miscellaneous Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Swing the music instead of sounding like sewing machine. Group notes
and play them by creating a forward motion.</li>
<li>Focus on more on the sensations of touch and movement and use your
vision mainly to check that what you feel is in accord with what you
see. <span class="citation"
