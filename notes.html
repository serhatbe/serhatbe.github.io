<h1>Volūmen</h1>
<p>Volūmen is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes.
However, I mainly use notebooks and write by hand to process my
thoughts. The term volūmen is Latin for “scroll” referring to a rolled
manuscript. In ancient Rome, a volūmen (plural: volūmina) was the
standard format for written texts before the codex, or bound book,
became common.</p>

<p>2025-08-04</p>
<p>Ultimate satisfaction arises from performing small rituals,
regardless of success or failure. Rather than fixating on large goals,
Mogi <span class="citation" data-cites="mogiLittleBookIkigai2018">(Mogi,
2018)</span> encourages us to focus on small, relatable tasks we can
engage in daily. Practice for the sake of practice, following Suzuki’s
<span class="citation" data-cites="suzukiZenMindBeginner2020">(Suzuki,
2020)</span> teaching. Pause and reflect: what is truly wonderful is the
act of practice itself. Then begin again and continue practicing. When
you follow this simple rule, you may gain unexpected powers. Before you
attain them, they seem extraordinary; afterward, they feel like nothing
special. And that is the ultimate satisfaction.</p>

<h1 id="one-and-done">One and Done</h1>
<p>2025-08-04</p>
<p>I find myself increasingly drawn to a “one-and-done” philosophy when
it comes to worldly possessions. There’s a quiet realization that I
don’t have enough time to truly experience or make good use of the
things I have, like pens, guitars, and other tools. It seems that to
understand something deeply, to let it reveal its full functionality
over time, one must live with it for years. Multiplicity divides
attention; depth asks for commitment.</p>

<h1 id="premature-optimization">Premature Optimization</h1>
<p>2025-08-03</p>
<p>As Donald Knuth wrote in 1974, programmers often waste effort
optimizing too early; “premature optimization is the root of all evil
(or at least most of it) in programming” <span class="citation"
data-cites="knuthStructuredProgrammingGo1974">(Knuth, 1974)</span>. This
sentiment applies beyond code. We often fall into the trap of
optimization too early, whether in programming, designing a template, or
starting an exercise routine. Instead of putting a functional version to
use, we start tweaking it, reshaping it until we barely recognize it. As
a result, we lose the value of the original. The code ends up doing
things we do not need, the template produces excessive output, and the
workout becomes so complicated that it discourages us from following
through.</p>
<p>It is often better to stick with the raw idea, no matter how rough or
unrefined it may be. If you follow it long enough, perhaps for a year or
even a month, you may start to notice natural patterns emerge. Haruki
Murakami describes a similar experience in <em>Novelist as a
Vocation</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="murakamiNovelistVocation2022">(Murakami, 2022)</span>. Early
in his career, feeling constrained by traditional Japanese prose, he
began writing in English and then translating the text back into
Japanese. The process was not optimal, but it helped him discover a
personal voice. Rather than optimizing the method, he committed to it,
letting clarity and style emerge over time through repeated
practice.</p>

<p>Daniel Kahneman said most people make quick judgments and then try to

<p>I recently learned that Kahneman passed away on March 27, 2024,
though his death wasn’t announced until March 2025. He was best known
for his work on System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is fast and
automatic but prone to errors. System 2 is slower and more deliberate,
used for careful thinking and problem-solving.</p>

<h1 id="truth-lies--deception">Truth, Lies &amp; Deception</h1>
<p>2025-05-31</p>
<p>A Turkish proverb says, “A fool may throw a stone into a well that a
hundred wise men cannot pull out.” Inspired by this, one observation is,
“One lie cannot be undone by forty truths.” Both express that a single
careless act can have severe consequences, even with effort and truth.
They highlight the asymmetry between destruction and repair, deception
and truth.</p>
<h2 id="compare-and-contrast">Compare and Contrast</h2>
<p>The first proverb suggests reckless actions can create problems even
the wisest struggle to fix. The metaphor of the stone in the well
emphasizes permanence and unintended consequences.</p>
<p>The second saying shifts the focus to honesty and deception. A single
lie, once spoken, alters perception and trust, making it difficult to
correct with numerous truths. Like the stone in the well, the damage
lingers.</p>
<p>Both reflect human nature: words and actions, especially careless
ones, can have a greater impact than we anticipate. Even wisdom and
truth have limits in undoing past mistakes.</p>
<p>The wise are powerless against certain forms of foolishness. The
assumption that knowledge and truth can always correct falsehoods is an
illusion. Wisdom can only mitigate consequences, not erase them. True
wisdom may lie in recognizing that some things, once done, can’t be
undone. Ultimately, responsibility lies in preventing harm before it
occurs. Once the stone is in the well or the lie is spoken, the damage
is done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A single lie lingers, no matter how many truths try to wash it away.

<p>Concision is to mind what cleanliness is to the body. Concision, like
cleanliness, plays a crucial role in personal and professional life.
Just as cleanliness eliminates dirt and clutter from the body, concision
eliminates unnecessary words and ideas from communication, leaving
behind clear, precise, and effective messages.</p>

overcomplication—just as a clean body is free from excess grime. In both

<h1 id="on-truthfulness">On Truthfulness</h1>
<p>2025-02-02</p>
<p>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. However, never tell the truth when dealing with a fool,
for only a fool is capable of distorting and destroying the truth.</p>
<p>This rule presents a nuanced view of truthfulness, balancing moral
integrity with practical wisdom.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Always be truthful in your actions, even when the truth is
inconvenient. This emphasizes integrity and consistency. Actions should
reflect truth, even when it is difficult or disadvantageous. Honesty in
behavior builds trust and self-respect.</li>
<li>Never tell the truth when dealing with a fool, for only a fool is
capable of distorting and destroying the truth. Here, “fool” likely
refers to someone who lacks wisdom, is incapable of understanding truth,
or deliberately twists it. In such cases, speaking the truth can be
harmful rather than enlightening. A fool may manipulate truth to serve
their own misunderstanding or deception.</li>
</ol>
<p>Underlying Principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Truth should be upheld in one’s own actions and character.</li>
<li>However, truth should be wisely shared, considering the capacity of
the listener to understand and respect it.</li>
<li>Sometimes, silence or discretion is more powerful than speaking the
truth to those who will misuse it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This aligns with ancient wisdom, like in Proverbs:</p>
<p>“Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be
just like him.” (Proverbs 26:4)</p>

<li>To sort things out, the one who’s causing the mess in the first
place should carry the burden of proof.<br />
</li>
<li>In any interaction, the one taking action—rather than the one
responding—should bear the burden of proof.<br />
</li>
<li>In cases of organizations vs. individuals, especially in hazardous
situations, the organization should carry the burden of proof. Still,
individuals must use their own judgment to stay safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, do justly, the best you can—and keep course correcting.

<h1 id="on-true-practice">On True Practice</h1>
<p>2024-01-05</p>
<p>To the beginner: practice without effort is not true practice; the
practice needs great effort.</p>
<p>Practice little by little. When walking in a fog, you don’t realize
you’re getting wet, but as you keep walking, you get wet little by
little. When you get in a fog, it’s very difficult to dry yourself.
Practicing slowly is the same; true progress is the result of slow
practice, little by little.</p>
<p>When you keep this simple practice, you will obtain some wonderful
powers. Before you attain it, it’s something wonderful, but after you
attain it, it’s nothing special.</p>
<p>Stop and think: what is wonderful is the act of practice itself. Now
you can restart and keep practicing.</p>
<p>When there’s no gaining idea in what you do, then you do
something.</p>
<p>Forget all gaining ideas, all dualistic ideas. Just practice zazen in
a certain posture.</p>

<h1 id="rules-of-the-game">Rules of the Game</h1>
<p>2023-10-31</p>
<p>It is more feasible to play and potentially win a game of chess when
competing against an opponent who is also adhering to the rules of
chess. It is inconceivable to assume otherwise, as an opponent playing a
different game would fundamentally undermine the contest. Nevertheless,
it is entirely possible for individuals to engage in games without
adhering to established rules. A prudent individual must pause and
consider whether both parties are indeed playing the same game.</p>
<p>People frequently disregard or bend rules and conventions. Therefore,
one should never assume that an opponent is fully aware of the rules or
will adhere to the intended structure of the game.</p>
<p>Competent chess players often find it challenging to compete against
complete novices, as they are frequently surprised by the unconventional
moves novices make.</p>
<p>This principle extends beyond chess to any rule-based interaction,
where mutual understanding of conventions is critical.</p>

<p>The objective is to make everything as simple as possible, but not

However, the risk of oversimplification must be considered, as it may
compromise the desired outcome. Thus, self-imposed constraints can be
regarded as an art form, enabling the effective achievement of
goals.</p>
<p>When a task involves numerous steps or requires substantial

constraints help minimize or eliminate distractions and foster

<p>2023-August-11</p>
<h2 id="lessons-from-the-book">Lessons from the Book</h2>
<p>Many jobs are pointless or most jobs have elements of pointless
activities. Pay attention to the people and the positions they hold. If
you identify any of the five types, do not waste your precious time.
Most importantly if you discover your job is nothing but bs, you must
find ways to deal with its latent consequences. Many people suffered
from bs jobs and others occupied themselves with learning other skills
(e.g. languages, programming, etc.) while holding bs jobs.</p>
<p>David Graeber lists five different categories of job types <span
class="citation" data-cites="graeberBullshitJobsTheory2018">Graeber
(2018)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flunkies, who serve to make their superiors feel important,
e.g., receptionists, administrative assistants, door attendants, store
greeters, makers of websites whose sites neglect ease of use and speed
for looks;</li>
<li>Goons, who act to harm or deceive others on behalf of their
employer, e.g., lobbyists, corporate lawyers, telemarketers, public
relations specialists, community managers;</li>
<li>Duct tapers, who temporarily fix problems that could be fixed
permanently, e.g., programmers repairing bloated code, airline desk
staff who calm passengers whose bags do not arrive;</li>
<li>Box tickers, who create the appearance that something useful is
being done when it is not, e.g., survey administrators, in-house
magazine journalists, corporate compliance officers, quality
service managers;</li>
<li>Taskmasters, who create extra work for those who do not need it,
e.g., middle management, leadership professionals.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>A bullshit job is one that even the person doing it secretly believes
need not, or should not, exist. That if the job, or even the whole
industry, were to vanish, either it would make no difference to anyone,
or the world might even be a slightly better place. - David Graeber</p>

<p>News can shape our perceptions in distinct ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive news: Uplifting stories, affirmations, and
encouragement.</li>
<li>Negative news: Drama, criticism, and controversy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our workplaces, communities, or neighborhoods, whether a high-rise
building, a city block, or a small town, news circulates constantly,
influencing our decisions. To maintain clarity, we must discern what is
truly valuable from what is mere noise. Often, this means turning off

<p>To begin, you require only a book, a pen, and time. While additional

negative utility. These tools do not accelerate your work; rather, they
consume as much time as you are willing to expend on them. The essence
of productivity lies in performing the work itself.</p>

<p>Work expands to fill the time available for its completion

<p>You could divert your attention to numerous optimizations, such as
managing email, scheduling meetings, organizing notes, maintaining
calendars, tracking time, setting goals, creating to-do lists,
estimating time requirements, applying prioritization frameworks, using
quantified self-sensors, analyzing data, adopting apps, managing
documents, or journaling.</p>
<p>However, it is critical to resist the temptation to become mired in
these optimizations. Instead, prioritize executing the work. When you

themselves.</p>
