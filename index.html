	<p>I am a faculty member in the Marine Engineering Department of <a href="https://youtu.be/0G45bIA52Mw">Marine Campus</a> at British Columbia Institute of Technology<!-- <a href="https://youtu.be/xayJaGy2XA8">(BCIT)</a> -->. I have also taught power engineering in the Power Engineering Department at BCIT. Prior to joining BCIT, I have worked on various types of ocean-going ships. My seagoing experience includes a wide range of commercial ships, such as cargo vessels, bulk carriers, product oil tankers, and crude oil carriers. When off-duty, I enjoy reading, listening to music, long hikes, and traveling.</p>
