<p>Some problems come from life itself—they shape us, test us, make us
stronger. Struggling with them gives the soul weight and meaning. But
other problems are man-made—born of fear, control, and small minds. They
do not lift us up; they drain us. In places ruled by politics and
pretense, effort leads nowhere. Spirit fades. It is better to face real
storms than to rot in still air. Better a hard truth than a quiet,
comfortable lie.</p>
