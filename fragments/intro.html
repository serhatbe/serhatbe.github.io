<p>Volūmen is a personal repository where I occasionally post my notes.
However, I primarily use notebooks and write by hand to process my
thoughts. The term volūmen is Latin for “scroll,” referring to a rolled
manuscript. In Roman times, a volūmen (plural: volūmina) was the
standard form of written text before the codex i.e. bound book became
widespread.</p>
