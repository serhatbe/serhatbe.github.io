<p>To the beginner: practice without effort is not true practice; the
practice needs great effort.</p>
<p>Practice little by little. When walking in a fog, you don’t realize
you’re getting wet, but as you keep walking, you get wet little by
little. When you get in a fog, it’s very difficult to dry yourself.
Practicing slowly is the same; true progress is the result of slow
practice, little by little.</p>
<p>When you keep this simple practice, you will obtain some wonderful
powers. Before you attain it, it’s something wonderful, but after you
attain it, it’s nothing special.</p>
<p>Stop and think: what is wonderful is the act of practice itself. Now
you can restart and keep practicing.</p>
<p>When there’s no gaining idea in what you do, then you do
something.</p>
<p>Forget all gaining ideas, all dualistic ideas. Just practice zazen in
a certain posture.</p>
