<p>The objective is to make everything as simple as possible, but not
simpler. (Albert Einstein is known to have said that). Self-imposed
constraints facilitate the simplification of concepts and processes.
However, the risk of oversimplification must be considered, as it may
compromise the desired outcome. Thus, self-imposed constraints can be
regarded as an art form, enabling the effective achievement of
goals.</p>
<p>When a task involves numerous steps or requires substantial
resources, its completion becomes increasingly challenging. Self-imposed
constraints help minimize or eliminate distractions and foster
creativity. Creativity, in turn, is the key to originality.</p>
