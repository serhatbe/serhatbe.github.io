<h1 id="one-and-done">One and Done</h1>
<p>2025-08-04</p>
<p>I find myself increasingly drawn to a “one-and-done” philosophy when
it comes to worldly possessions. There’s a quiet realization that I
don’t have enough time to truly experience or make good use of the
things I have, like pens, guitars, and other tools. It seems that to
understand something deeply, to let it reveal its full functionality
over time, one must live with it for years. Multiplicity divides
attention; depth asks for commitment.</p>
