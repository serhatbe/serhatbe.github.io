<p>Last update: 2025-08-03</p>
<p>As Donald Knuth wrote in 1974, programmers often waste effort
optimizing too early; “premature optimization is the root of all evil
(or at least most of it) in programming” <span class="citation"
data-cites="knuthStructuredProgrammingGo1974">(Knuth, 1974)</span>. This
sentiment applies beyond code. We often fall into the trap of
optimization too early, whether in programming, designing a template, or
starting an exercise routine. Instead of putting a functional version to
use, we start tweaking it, reshaping it until we barely recognize it. As
a result, we lose the value of the original. The code ends up doing
things we do not need, the template produces excessive output, and the
workout becomes so complicated that it discourages us from following
through.</p>
<p>It is often better to stick with the raw idea, no matter how rough or
unrefined it may be. If you follow it long enough, perhaps for a month
or even a year, you may start to notice natural patterns emerge. Haruki
Murakami describes a similar experience in <em>Novelist as a
Vocation</em> <span class="citation"
data-cites="murakamiNovelistVocation2022">(Murakami, 2022)</span>. Early
in his career, feeling constrained by traditional Japanese prose, he
began writing in English and then translating the text back into
Japanese. The process was not optimal, but it helped him discover a
personal voice. Rather than optimizing the method, he committed to it,
letting clarity and style emerge over time through repeated
practice.</p>
