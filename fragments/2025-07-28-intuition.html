<p>I learned that Daniel Kahneman died on March 27, 2024, but his death
was only revealed in March 2025. Kahneman was known for his analysis of
System 1 and System 2 thinking. He said most people make quick judgments
and spend their time proving themselves right. The wisest wait, gather
the facts, and trust their intuition last.</p>
