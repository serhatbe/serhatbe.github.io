### Teaching Philosophy  

I view the college experience as a formative period, not only for career preparation, but also for the development of essential life skills. My goal is to help students make the most of this demanding stage by encouraging critical thinking, resilience, and sustained intellectual growth.

### Continuum  

I regard professional development as a continuous process rather than a fixed endpoint. To support this perspective, I design courses that promote independent learning and encourage students to extend their growth beyond the classroom. Self-directed and web-based components are integrated to help students build independent, lasting strategies for continued learning.

### Technology Integration

Technology is a key element of my teaching approach, not as a replacement for sound pedagogy, but as a tool to enhance it. I use learning management systems, simulations, and engineering software to support diverse learning needs and increase engagement. My experience with online and hybrid delivery has underscored the importance of clarity, structure, and accessibility. I also emphasize digital literacy to prepare students for the thoughtful and effective use of technology in their professional lives.
