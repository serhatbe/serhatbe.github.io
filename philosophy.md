### Teaching Philosophy  
I believe that the college years represent a pivotal phase in an individual’s life—not only for securing employment after graduation but, more importantly, for developing essential life skills. My primary goal is to help students maximize the opportunities presented during this critical period.

#### Continuum  
I view professional mastery as an ongoing journey rather than a goal achieved upon completion of a vocational or college program. To foster lifelong learning, I strive to guide students from their current studies toward subsequent educational and professional development. My courses incorporate elements of self-directed and web-based learning, which I intend to empower students to construct personalized learning pathways.

#### Technology Integration
Technology plays a vital role in my teaching practice—not as a substitute for effective pedagogy, but as a means to enhance it. I regularly integrate tools such as learning management systems, simulators, and engineering software to accommodate diverse learning styles and increase student engagement. My experience with online and hybrid course delivery has reinforced the importance of clarity, organization, and accessibility in digital learning environments. Additionally, I emphasize the development of digital literacy to prepare students to use technology thoughtfully and effectively in their careers. Ultimately, I consider technology a valuable tool that facilitates deeper reflection and more meaningful learning.
