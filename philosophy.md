## Teaching Philosophy
I believe that the college period is a significant phase in one’s life. Not only because we get a job after graduation but probably more importantly we acquire essential life skills at school. My primary goal is therefore to help my students to make the best of this period in their lives.

## Teaching
My method of teaching can be characterized by helping students build confidence through what they are learning, progressively challenging them with new concepts and confronting them with appropriately difficult problems towards the end of teaching process. My primary function in this demanding process is to initiate students into knowledge building and guide their exploration of new information from which they can expand their existing learning capacity. Ultimately, I aim to create an engaging and active learning environment in which they can develop mental toughness, critical thinking skills and disciplined perspectives to real life.

## Evaluation
The degree of difficulty in my students’ evaluation is inversely proportional to the rigorous learning process they go through. This is not because my exams are easier but it is in part due to their deeper learning and in part due to my liberal approach to marking student work. I believe that grading is not an exact science and a teacher cannot consistently and fairly evaluate students’ performance. To tackle this challenging task, I use grading matrices where performance indicators and their corresponding numerical values are communicated to students clearly. A substantial portion of the total mark is assigned to the content thereby encouraging students to achieve the primary learning outcomes.

## Continuum
I consider mastering a profession as a continuum, not through a series of schooling that terminate after completing a vocational school or college program. Thus, I promote life-long learning by attempting to transition my students from their time with me to their next learning endeavor. Ingrained in my courses are the elements of self-directed and web-based learning both of which, I hope, will help my students to construct their own learning paths.
