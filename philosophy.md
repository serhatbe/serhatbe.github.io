### Teaching Philosophy  
I believe that the college years are a pivotal time in a person’s life—not just for securing a job after graduation, but more importantly, for developing essential life skills. My primary goal is to help students make the most of this important period.

#### Continuum  
I see professional mastery as a continuous journey, not something that ends with the completion of a vocational or college program. To support lifelong learning, I aim to guide students from their current studies into future learning experiences. My courses include elements of self-directed and web-based learning, which I hope will empower students to build their own learning paths.
