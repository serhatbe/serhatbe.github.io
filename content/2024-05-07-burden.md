Who should have the burden of proof?

- To sort things out, the one who’s causing the mess in the first place should carry the burden of proof.  
- In any interaction, the one taking action—rather than the one responding—should bear the burden of proof.  
- In cases of organizations vs. individuals, especially in hazardous situations, the organization should carry the burden of proof. Still, individuals must use their own judgment to stay safe.

In the end, do justly, the best you can—and keep course correcting. Remember what Dylan said: “All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie.”
