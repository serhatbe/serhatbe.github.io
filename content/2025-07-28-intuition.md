Daniel Kahneman said most people make quick judgments and then try to prove themselves right. The wisest wait, gather facts, and trust their intuition last.

I recently learned that Kahneman passed away on March 27, 2024, though his death wasnâ€™t announced until March 2025. He was best known for his work on System 1 and System 2 thinking. System 1 is fast and automatic but prone to errors. System 2 is slower and more deliberate, used for careful thinking and problem-solving.
